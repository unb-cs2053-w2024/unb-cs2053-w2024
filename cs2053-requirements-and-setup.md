# Software Setup and Requirements for CS 2053

This course requires you to use the Godot Engine in your course work to create games. The Godot Engine v4.2 should be installed on FCS lab windows machines. Godot is multi-platform (Windows/Mac/Linux), but you will be tested on Windows. You may develop wherever you wish, but test on Windows before submission. 

- [Download Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download/)

## TL;DR

- We will be using Godot Engine 4.2.1. This is NOT negotiable. Your TAs will be marking with this version of Unity and compatibility is YOUR responsibility.
- Godot has a nice built in editor, but if you want [you can configure it to work on other editors](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/configuring_an_ide/visual_studio_code.html). This is up to you and will not be supported in class.
- We will use GitHub for as much as possible in the class, and recommend using the GitHub Desktop for this. Setting up for CLI and such with github requires token generation or ssh and more. You can use the command line but it will be up to you to figure things out.

## Create a GitHub Account

We will use GitHub extensively in this class to access code and submit assignments. This takes a little bit of learning to begin with, but it is well worth the little bit of effort. You will use the same account for everything in this class, so you might consider making a new account.

- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) (if you don't already have one)

## Register your GitHub Account for the Class

Use the same account for everything you do in the class, so we can always track down your work:

- [Register your GitHub username here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=0m5OJJoz80e5XORTUcGYt2F8PjYD7qJHiHDGUbqLnp1UNkQzSjA1RkNOUzNJNk1KRTVQVkhMRUM1VC4u)

## Install GitHub Desktop

We will use GitHub Desktop for get access to code and submitting your work. It can make using GitHub easier than the command line.
